problem: createQuery without get yellow underline, resultSet = false,

problem: is public, every use of builder can add an id, no setter.

dao >> CompaniesDao
function: getCompanyByID
note: changed name
in instruction name is: "getOneCompany"

facade >> AdminFacade

problem: when deleting purchase history, need to update coupon amount?
