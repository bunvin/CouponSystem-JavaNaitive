September 30th recording

beans >> Company
function: builder.id
in use in: getCompany, getCompanyById
problem: is public, every use of builder can add an id, no setter.

facade >> AdminFacade
function: update Company
problem: working but ugly if statement
the if statement targets
1. Company name == dbCompany name
2. Company Id == dbCompany Id OR Company Id == 0
