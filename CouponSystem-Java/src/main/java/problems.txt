-testing unclear
-need to add remove all connections
NOTE:
I didn't understand it all that well
September 30th recording

beans >> Company
function: builder.id
in use in: getCompany, getCompanyById
problem: is public, every use of builder can add an id, no setter.

facade >> AdminFacade
function: update Company
problem: working but ugly if statement
the if statement targets
1. Company name == dbCompany name
2. Company Id == dbCompany Id OR Company Id == 0


dbDAO >> CouponExpirationDailyJob
function: run
problem: when checking how long to midnight, it gives a negative milliseconds from the start of the day
fix: calculate now until 23:59 and added a minute when checking
