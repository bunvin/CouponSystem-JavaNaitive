>>beans- all classes, also called models
>>dao- all interfaces
>>dbDao- the implements of the interfaces
>>db- connecting details to db and managing the connections
-------------------------------------------------

db >> ConnectionPool
functions: getConnectionPool, getConnectionList, getConnection, releaseConnection
problem:
- connectionList requested as Set<> but it's in List<> for testing
-testing unclear
-need to add remove all connections
NOTE:
I didn't understand it all that well
September 30th recording

db >> DBManager
function: createQuery
problem: createQuery without get yellow underline, resultSet = false,
suggested change function to void

beans >> Company
function: builder.id
in use in: getCompany, getCompanyById
problem: is public, every use of builder can add an id, no setter.

dao >> CompaniesDao
function: getCompanyByID
note: changed name
in instruction name is: "getOneCompany"

facade >> ClientFacade
functions: all
problem: understanding
create new Interface objects (CompaniesDAO , etc)
are they, working? yes. sdded a customer
should I import DBDAO instead of the DAO?
Does it go directly to the interface?
